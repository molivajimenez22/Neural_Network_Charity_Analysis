# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to predict which organizations were worth donating to and which had higher risks. Using machine learning and neural networks, I created a binary classifier capable of predicting if an organization, based on their appliation, would be successful if funding was received.
